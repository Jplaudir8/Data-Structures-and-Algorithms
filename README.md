### Project 1 - Big Numbers Calculator

This is a calculator of integer numbers that can have a size bigger than normal 32-bit and 64-bit integers. Possible operations that it can hold are: Addition, Multiplication and Exponentiation. A linked-list is used as part of the implementation.

### Project 2 - DNA Trie-like Database

The DNAtree class represents a Trie-like data structure that stores DNA sequences as String objects.

### Project 3 - External Sorting

This program represents an external sort algorithm. The program sorts a set of fixed-length records of 16 bytes. It starts by generating a series of sorted subsets(runs) through replacement selection. Once these runs have been generated, they go through a merging phase, where a multi-way merge algorithm is implemented. The program finalizes by generating a file with all the records sorted. Access to the binary file to be sorted is performed through RandomAccessFile to preserve I/O efficiency.


### Project 4 - SkipList-based storage

The following program implements a SkipList database that is capable of storing Rectangles in a coordinate plane within the constraints of a "world box" located at 0,0 and with dimensions of 1024 x 1024.

These projects were developed along with @ranarhm
